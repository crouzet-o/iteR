# ite-R
A package for computing Information Transfer rate and Entropy on confusion matrices in R

This packages will provide functions for the computation of Information Transfer
Rates in Confusion Matrices as described in Miller & Nicely (1955). See also
Christiansen & Greenberg (2012).


# Notes

SINFA is a method that can provide analyses of the relative information transfer rates between features (Wang & Bilger, 1973).

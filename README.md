# ite-R
A package for computing Information Transfer Rate on confusion matrices in R

This packages provides functions for the computation of Information Transfer
Rates in Confusion Matrices as described in Miller & Nicely (1955). See also
Christiansen & Greenberg (2005).


# Notes

SINFA is a method that can provide analyses of the relative information transfer rates between features. However it works on binary features only and it may not be able to compare transfer rates between conditions. I have to investigate in order to compare the approaches.

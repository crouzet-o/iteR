# information transmission and entropy with R

A package for computing Information Transfer rates / Mutual Information and Entropy in R

This package is currently in active development. It has been designed for linguists as well as speech and cognitive scientists and will provide functions for the computation of Information Transfer Rates in Confusion Matrices as described in Miller & Nicely (1955) and later in Christiansen & Greenberg (2012) as well as for the computation of Mutual Information in coarticulated speech (Iskarous et al, 2013).

Description: The iteR package provides tools for the manipulation and analysis
    of confusion matrices as used in human and machine classification experiments.
    One of its main uses is for the computation of Miller & Nicely's (1955) raw
    and normalized Information Transfer rate computations for NxN-class confusion
    matrices (See also Christiansen & Greenberg, 2005 for a more recent usage).
    The package also provides tools for facilitating the manipulation of confusion
    matrices (e.g. turning an NxN-class confusion matrix into a 2x2, 3x3... MxM
    (with M<N) confusion matrix.
